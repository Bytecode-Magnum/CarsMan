# Car Manufacturing Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## Overview
Welcome to the Car Manufacturing Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project!. In this project, we delve into a comprehensive dataset containing information about various car models manufactured by different companies. The dataset includes essential attributes such as make, model, year, engine specifications, transmission type, driven wheels, number of doors, market category, vehicle size, vehicle style, highway MPG, city MPG, popularity, and MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price).

## Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to gain valuable insights into the dataset through exploratory data analysis. By performing data exploration and visualization, we aim to uncover meaningful patterns, relationships, and trends among different variables. This analysis will provide a better understanding of the factors influencing car features and pricing, as well as identifying popular car models and market categories.

## Dataset Description
The dataset comprises a sample of car models manufactured in 2011. Each entry represents a unique car model with various attributes recorded. Here are the key attributes in the dataset:

Make: The company or manufacturer of the car.

Model: The specific model name of the car.

Year: The manufacturing year of the car model.

Engine Fuel Type: The fuel type required for the car's engine.

Engine HP: The horsepower of the car's engine.

Engine Cylinders: The number of cylinders in the car's engine.

Transmission Type: The type of transmission (e.g., MANUAL, AUTOMATIC).

Driven Wheels: The wheels that receive power from the engine (e.g., rear-wheel drive, all-wheel drive).

Number of Doors: The number of doors the car has.

Market Category: The category or type of market the car is aimed at.

Vehicle Size: The size classification of the vehicle (e.g., Compact, Midsize, Large).

Vehicle Style: The style or body type of the vehicle (e.g., Coupe, Convertible).

Highway MPG: The miles per gallon the car can achieve on the highway.

City MPG: The miles per gallon the car can achieve in city driving.

Popularity: A measure of the car's popularity based on various factors.

MSRP: The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price of the car model.

## Project Steps
In this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project, we analyzed a comprehensive car manufacturing dataset containing information about various car models. We performed data cleaning to handle missing values and duplicates. Through data visualization, we gained insights into the distribution and relationships of different attributes such as MPG, MSRP, and popularity. Correlation analysis helped us identify significant connections between numerical variables. The project will follow these steps for exploratory data analysis:

## Usage
